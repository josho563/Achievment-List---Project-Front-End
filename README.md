# Achievment-List---Project-Front-End
Introduction:
The Specifications was to create a CRUD application that covered both front-end and back-end using the technology I had been taught.

 
Project Management:
 - I have been taught how to create Jira boards and what made up a MVP so this is where I began.

 Jira Board used = Scrum
On this project firstly, I approached the Introduction section within the specification I had been given. I took on this information and used to make up my minimum viable product for the application, using this information I then wrote them as User Stories in Jira.

- The overall objective was to create CRUD application using a range of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies.
- I created user stories tasking myself to configure and use certain technologies during the project such as maintaining a version control system and to use Spring boot in eclipse another example was also to use the Axios Library for my HTTP CRUD requests.

Version Control:
- During my learning period I had also been taught how to use GitHub and how its used for version control.
- Throughout the project I wanted to stick to the feature branch model to ensure I followed the best practices where possible.

Databases:
 - I had been taught how to use MySQL workbench and how to create database. As the Developer I needed to implement a relational database within MySQL, I needed this to store my data persistently for the project I also needed a H2 database to run tests against.

Java SE & Spring Boot:
 - During my learning period I was shown Spring Boot and how it can be used to create an application which can act as an API to join a front end and back-end system togetger.

Testing:
 - I have driven to try and reach an acceptable level of test coverage on back-end this was done by using primaraly MockMVC but also (JUnit4/5 and Mockito).

Front-End Development:
 - During my learning I have been taught about 3 new programming languages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is what I used to build my front-end website to then join up with my API.
 - A key technology found in my project was Axios Library I used this to make HTTP requests for my CRUD functions.
